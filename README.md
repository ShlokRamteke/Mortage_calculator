# Interest Calculator

## Overview
This is a hobby project, which have helped me learn about building frontend with React.

The Interest Calculator is a React app that allows users to calculate the amount of interest to be paid for a house based on the down payment, interest percentage, and tenure period. The app provides a graphical representation of the interest breakup using a pie chart and allows users to select the amount using a slider.
